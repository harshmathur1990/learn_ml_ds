He</c><c id=\"5\"> wanted to make a quiet</c><c id=\"6\"> entry and lie low for</c><c id=\"7\"> a few days. He hadn't</c><c id=\"8\"> informed his mother and wanted</c><c id=\"9\"> to surprise family and friends.</c><c id=\"10\"> But an over-enthusiastic neighbour who</c><c id=\"11\"> worked in a leading national</c><c id=\"12\"> daily was quick to pass</c><c id=\"13\"> on the information. Riddhimaan had</c><c id=\"14\"> missed his ancestral home, but</c><c id=\"15\"> hadn't realized that there would</c><c id=\"16\"> be so much frenzy all</c><c id=\"17\"> around.

Riddhimaan had</c><c id=\"27\"> even toyed with the idea</c><c id=\"28\"> of getting married. If that</c><c id=\"29\"> could assure him of some</c><c id=\"30\"> company, fill up his empty</c><c id=\"31\"> flat, he would settle for</c><c id=\"32\"> that too.

He had returned</c><c id=\"6\"> to the land of his</c><c id=\"7\"> birth, the house he had</c><c id=\"8\"> loved so much growing up</c><c id=\"9\"> and for a promise he</c><c id=\"10\"> had made to his father.</c><c id=\"11\"> But deep down he knew</c><c id=\"12\"> his thoughts had begun to</c><c id=\"13\"> scare him. The real reason</c><c id=\"14\"> was his insecurity.</c></p><p><c id=\"15\">The veranda was a favourite</c><c id=\"16\"> haunt and he had started</c><c id=\"17\"> feeling much better now. Maybe</c><c id=\"18\"> death wasn't all around him.</c><c id=\"19\"> Rather spring was round the</c><c id=\"20\"> corner. The leaves of the</c><c id=\"21\"> mango tree were a delightful</c><c id=\"22\"> green and Riddimaan reminisced about</c><c id=\"23\"> his childhood. The tree had</c><c id=\"24\"> begun to flower and come</c><c id=\"25\"> April it would be laden</c><c id=\"26\"> with his favourite fruit. As</c><c id=\"27\"> a child he was extremely</c><c id=\"28\"> possessive about the tree, and</c><c id=\"29\"> made sure not a single</c><c id=\"30\"> fruit was distributed in the</c><c id=\"31\"> neighbourhood. He was admonished by</c><c id=\"32\"> his parents, but that didn't</c><c id=\"33\"> change a thing. Riddhimaan smiled</c><c id=\"34\"> at the rush of memories</c><c id=\"35\"> as a koel sang it's</c><c id=\"36\"> heart out hidden among the</c><c id=\"37\"> leaves of the tree. The</c><c id=\"38\"> mysterious bird still made his</c><c id=\"39\"> heart beat faster than usual.</c><c id=\"40\"> It had made him bunk</c><c id=\"41\"> many classes at the university.</c><c id=\"42\"> 'Cruel bird, you make me</c><c id=\"43\"> seek love, but never reveal</c><c id=\"44\"> yourself!' he mused.</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"11ec91b8800a47538f8d3952847e3763","page_number":84,"segment_id":"1ce54f39ed004d3b85ce89b5227375c8"},{"content":"<span id=\"f0e15da8266243e89ed65efc443a5052\" class=\"segment\"><p><c id=\"0\">He smiled lazily and looked</c><c id=\"1\"> across the courtyard.
