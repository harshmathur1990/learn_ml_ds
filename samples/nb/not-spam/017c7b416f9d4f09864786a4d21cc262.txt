I was sub-divisional</c><c id=\"7\"> police officer of the town,</c><c id=\"8\"> and in an aimless, petty</c><c id=\"9\"> kind of way anti-European feeling</c><c id=\"10\"> was very bitter. No one</c><c id=\"11\"> had the guts to raise</c><c id=\"12\"> a riot, but if a</c><c id=\"13\"> European woman went through the</c><c id=\"14\"> bazaars alone somebody would probably</c><c id=\"15\"> spit betel juice over her</c><c id=\"16\"> dress.

The young Buddhist</c><c id=\"33\"> priests were the worst of</c><c id=\"34\"> all.

Theoretically —</c><c id=\"8\"> and secretly, of course —</c><c id=\"9\"> I was all for the</c><c id=\"10\"> Burmese and all against their</c><c id=\"11\"> oppressors, the British. As for</c><c id=\"12\"> the job I was doing,</c><c id=\"13\"> I hated it more bitterly</c><c id=\"14\"> than I can perhaps make</c><c id=\"15\"> clear. In a job like</c><c id=\"16\"> that you see the dirty</c><c id=\"17\"> work of Empire at close</c><c id=\"18\"> quarters. The wretched prisoners huddling</c><c id=\"19\"> in the stinking cages of</c><c id=\"20\"> the lock-ups, the grey, cowed</c><c id=\"21\"> faces of the long-term convicts,</c><c id=\"22\"> the scarred buttocks of the</c><c id=\"23\"> men who had been flogged</c><c id=\"24\"> with bamboos — all these</c><c id=\"25\"> oppressed me with an intolerable</c><c id=\"26\"> sense of guilt. But I</c><c id=\"27\"> could get nothing into perspective.</c><c id=\"28\"> I was young and ill-educated</c><c id=\"29\"> and I had had to</c><c id=\"30\"> think out my problems in</c><c id=\"31\"> the utter silence that is</c><c id=\"32\"> imposed on every Englishman in</c><c id=\"33\"> the East. I did not</c><c id=\"34\"> even know that the British</c><c id=\"35\"> Empire is dying, still less</c><c id=\"36\"> did I know that it</c><c id=\"37\"> is a great deal better</c><c id=\"38\"> than the younger empires that</c><c id=\"39\"> are going to supplant it.</c><c id=\"40\"> All I knew was that</c><c id=\"41\"> I was stuck between my</c><c id=\"42\"> hatred of the empire I</c><c id=\"43\"> served and my rage against</c><c id=\"44\"> the evil-spirited little beasts who</c><c id=\"45\"> tried to make my job</c><c id=\"46\"> impossible.

I remember that it</c><c id=\"9\"> was a cloudy, stuffy morning</c><c id=\"10\"> at the beginning of the</c><c id=\"11\"> rains. We began questioning the</c><c id=\"12\"> people as to where the</c><c id=\"13\"> elephant had gone and, as</c><c id=\"14\"> usual, failed to get any</c><c id=\"15\"> definite information. That is invariably</c><c id=\"16\"> the case in the East;</c><c id=\"17\"> a story always sounds clear</c><c id=\"18\"> enough at a distance, but</c><c id=\"19\"> the nearer you get to</c><c id=\"20\"> the scene of events the</c><c id=\"21\"> vaguer it becomes. Some of</c><c id=\"22\"> the people said that the</c><c id=\"23\"> elephant had gone in one</c><c id=\"24\"> direction, some said that he</c><c id=\"25\"> had gone in another, some</c><c id=\"26\"> professed not even to have</c><c id=\"27\"> heard of any elephant. I</c><c id=\"28\"> had almost made up my</c><c id=\"29\"> mind that the whole story</c><c id=\"30\"> was a pack of lies,</c><c id=\"31\"> when we heard yells a</c><c id=\"32\"> little distance away. There was</c><c id=\"33\"> a loud, scandalized cry of</c><c id=\"34\"> ‘Go away, child! Go away</c><c id=\"35\"> this instant!’ and an old</c><c id=\"36\"> woman with a switch in</c><c id=\"37\"> her hand came round the</c><c id=\"38\"> corner of a hut, violently</c><c id=\"39\"> shooing away a crowd of</c><c id=\"40\"> naked children. Some more women</c><c id=\"41\"> followed, clicking their tongues and</c><c id=\"42\"> exclaiming; evidently there was something</c><c id=\"43\"> that the children ought not</c><c id=\"44\"> to have seen. I rounded</c><c id=\"45\"> the hut and saw a</c><c id=\"46\"> man's dead body sprawling in</c><c id=\"47\"> the mud. He was an</c><c id=\"48\"> Indian, a black Dravidian coolie,</c><c id=\"49\"> almost naked, and he could</c><c id=\"50\"> not have been dead many</c><c id=\"51\"> minutes. The people said that</c><c id=\"52\"> the elephant had come suddenly</c><c id=\"53\"> upon him round the corner</c><c id=\"54\"> of the hut, caught him</c><c id=\"55\"> with its trunk, put its</c><c id=\"56\"> foot on his back and</c><c id=\"57\"> ground him into the earth.</c><c id=\"58\"> This was the rainy season</c><c id=\"59\"> and the ground was soft,</c><c id=\"60\"> and his face had scored</c><c id=\"61\"> a trench a foot deep</c><c id=\"62\"> and a couple of yards</c><c id=\"63\"> long. He was lying on</c><c id=\"64\"> his belly with arms crucified</c><c id=\"65\"> and head sharply twisted to</c><c id=\"66\"> one side. His face was</c><c id=\"67\"> coated with mud, the eyes</c><c id=\"68\"> wide open, the teeth bared</c><c id=\"69\"> and grinning with an expression</c><c id=\"70\"> of unendurable agony. (Never tell</c><c id=\"71\"> me, by the way, that</c><c id=\"72\"> the dead look peaceful. Most</c><c id=\"73\"> of the corpses I have</c><c id=\"74\"> seen looked devilish.) The friction</c><c id=\"75\"> of the great beast's foot</c><c id=\"76\"> had stripped the skin from</c><c id=\"77\"> his back as neatly as</c><c id=\"78\"> one skins a rabbit. As</c><c id=\"79\"> soon as I saw the</c><c id=\"80\"> dead man I sent an</c><c id=\"81\"> orderly to a friend's house</c><c id=\"82\"> nearby to borrow an elephant</c><c id=\"83\"> rifle. I had already sent</c><c id=\"84\"> back the pony, not wanting</c><c id=\"85\"> it to go mad with</c><c id=\"86\"> fright and throw me if</c><c id=\"87\"> it smelt the elephant.</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"fb8b8a3807364e9db8a8d33d8f9390ab","page_number":4,"segment_id":"4a49f35524fa4b988459d02b6bfb254f"},{"content":"<span id=\"a548462b307d409784183b63c5c744fc\" class=\"segment\"><p><c id=\"0\">The orderly came back in</c><c id=\"1\"> a few minutes with a</c><c id=\"2\"> rifle and five cartridges, and</c><c id=\"3\"> meanwhile some Burmans had arrived</c><c id=\"4\"> and told us that the</c><c id=\"5\"> elephant was in the paddy</c><c id=\"6\"> fields below, only a few</c><c id=\"7\"> hundred yards away. As I</c><c id=\"8\"> started forward practically the whole</c><c id=\"9\"> population of the quarter flocked</c><c id=\"10\"> out of the houses and</c><c id=\"11\"> followed me.

It was</c><c id=\"21\"> a bit of fun to</c><c id=\"22\"> them, as it would be</c><c id=\"23\"> to an English crowd; besides</c><c id=\"24\"> they wanted the meat.

At the</c><c id=\"38\"> bottom, when you got away</c><c id=\"39\"> from the huts, there was</c><c id=\"40\"> a metalled road and beyond</c><c id=\"41\"> that a miry waste of</c><c id=\"42\"> paddy fields a thousand yards</c><c id=\"43\"> across, not yet ploughed but</c><c id=\"44\"> soggy from the first rains</c><c id=\"45\"> and dotted with coarse grass.</c><c id=\"46\"> The elephant was standing eight</c><c id=\"47\"> yards from the road, his</c><c id=\"48\"> left side towards us. He</c><c id=\"49\"> took not the slightest notice</c><c id=\"50\"> of the crowd's approach. He</c><c id=\"51\"> was tearing up bunches of</c><c id=\"52\"> grass, beating them against his</c><c id=\"53\"> knees to clean them and</c><c id=\"54\"> stuffing them into his mouth.</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"fb8b8a3807364e9db8a8d33d8f9390ab","page_number":5,"segment_id":"a548462b307d409784183b63c5c744fc"},{"content":"<span id=\"45b8994966cc4f97a60b70b17260867b\" class=\"segment\"><p><c id=\"0\">I had halted on the</c><c id=\"1\"> road.

I</c><c id=\"44\"> perceived in this moment that</c><c id=\"45\"> when the white man turns</c><c id=\"46\"> tyrant it is his own</c><c id=\"47\"> freedom that he destroys. He</c><c id=\"48\"> becomes a sort of hollow,</c><c id=\"49\"> posing dummy, the conventionalized figure</c><c id=\"50\"> of a sahib. For it</c><c id=\"51\"> is the condition of his</c><c id=\"52\"> rule that he shall spend</c><c id=\"53\"> his life in trying to</c><c id=\"54\"> impress the ‘natives’, and so</c><c id=\"55\"> in every crisis he has</c><c id=\"56\"> got to do what the</c><c id=\"57\"> ‘natives’ expect of him.
