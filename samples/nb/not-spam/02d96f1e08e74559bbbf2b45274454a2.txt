The plan that</c><c id=\"57\"> had been agreed on for</c><c id=\"58\"> this, the greatest of all</c><c id=\"59\"> practical jokes, was that Dansay,</c><c id=\"60\"> sewn up in one of</c><c id=\"61\"> his bearskins, was to be</c><c id=\"62\"> conducted by the girls two</c><c id=\"63\"> miles up the Naini Tal</c><c id=\"64\"> road to where there was</c><c id=\"65\"> a sharp bend on the</c><c id=\"66\"> road.
