Morning</c><c id=\"29\"> meeting in the soft drink</c><c id=\"30\"> industry is an every-day ritual,</c><c id=\"31\"> comparable to the morning prayers</c><c id=\"32\"> of an average Hindu. You</c><c id=\"33\"> just can’t start your day</c><c id=\"34\"> without it.

In the last</c><c id=\"6\"> 17-18 years of the re-emergence</c><c id=\"7\"> of the soft drink industry</c><c id=\"8\"> in India, it has been</c><c id=\"9\"> dominated by two global players</c><c id=\"10\"> TUCC and TACC (The American</c><c id=\"11\"> Cola Comapnay). TUCC was the</c><c id=\"12\"> older global brand that captured</c><c id=\"13\"> the consumer’s fancy and faith</c><c id=\"14\"> in the late nineteenth century</c><c id=\"15\"> and by the seventies became</c><c id=\"16\"> the world’s top brand.

I have</c><c id=\"28\"> yet to see a business</c><c id=\"29\"> presentation on India that does</c><c id=\"30\"> not begin with “India –The</c><c id=\"31\"> land of Opportunities” as the</c><c id=\"32\"> first slide. I am sure</c><c id=\"33\"> both TUCC and TACC saw</c><c id=\"34\"> and evaluated a similar presentation</c><c id=\"35\"> in the early nineties and</c><c id=\"36\"> jumped into the land, hoping</c><c id=\"37\"> to strike rich early, and</c><c id=\"38\"> make the Wall Street and</c><c id=\"39\"> their share holder’s dance to</c><c id=\"40\"> their tunes. Perhaps what they</c><c id=\"41\"> could not comprehend at that</c><c id=\"42\"> time was that despite there</c><c id=\"43\"> being millions of parched throats</c><c id=\"44\"> in the country, there were</c><c id=\"45\"> an equal number of empty</c><c id=\"46\"> pockets. While there was a</c><c id=\"47\"> substantial middle class population in</c><c id=\"48\"> India, fifty percent of India</c><c id=\"49\"> still lived in villages. And</c><c id=\"50\"> while the country had an</c><c id=\"51\"> intimidating young population, equally alarming</c><c id=\"52\"> was its un-employment. Both the</c><c id=\"53\"> companies invested heavily in infrastructure,</c><c id=\"54\"> marketing along with people and</c><c id=\"55\"> even after 15-16 years of</c><c id=\"56\"> operations, could not break even.</c><c id=\"57\"> For how long could the</c><c id=\"58\"> big daddies sitting in America</c><c id=\"59\"> feed their poor Indian babies?</c><c id=\"60\"> Pressure was building up on</c><c id=\"61\"> the Indian operations of the</c><c id=\"62\"> soft-drink companies to deliver both</c><c id=\"63\"> top-line and bottom-line i.e.sales and</c><c id=\"64\"> profit. This made competition fierce</c><c id=\"65\"> and slimy; both the players</c><c id=\"66\"> fought very hard each day</c><c id=\"67\"> and were ready to use</c><c id=\"68\"> any tactic to grab that</c><c id=\"69\"> elusive market share.</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"5fa0822aeeff41a99d04931486d1d449","page_number":8,"segment_id":"61615fd835fc471297f519cd54ac214a"},{"content":"<span id=\"c03c3350b9b8444cae0eca7cd9701cd7\" class=\"segment\"><p><c id=\"0\">  I smiled at the guys</c><c id=\"1\"> and greeted Dakshesh with “Kem</c><c id=\"2\"> Chho Dakshesh Bhai?” in local</c><c id=\"3\"> Gujarati. “Saaru Chandan Bhai, Tame</c><c id=\"4\"> kem chho?” Dakshesh replied with</c><c id=\"5\"> a dumb and unwilling smile</c><c id=\"6\"> as if someone was holding</c><c id=\"7\"> on to his fat lips.</c><c id=\"8\"> My sales executives respectfully wished</c><c id=\"9\"> me and paved way for</c><c id=\"10\"> me to pass.
