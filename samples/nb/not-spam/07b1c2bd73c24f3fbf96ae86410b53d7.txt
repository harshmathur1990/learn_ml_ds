When the</c><c id=\"10\"> last exam day rolled by</c><c id=\"11\"> – and it was an</c><c id=\"12\"> easy one – Bharath’s friends</c><c id=\"13\"> were ebullient.

A</c><c id=\"19\"> good ten days later he</c><c id=\"20\"> had to write his second</c><c id=\"21\"> attempt at the Control Systems</c><c id=\"22\"> exam.

He thought of</c><c id=\"33\"> everything that made him happy</c><c id=\"34\"> – stuffed and fried ladies’</c><c id=\"35\"> finger, movies, the occasional cigarette</c><c id=\"36\"> – and gladly gave it</c><c id=\"37\"> all up, hoping that his</c><c id=\"38\"> efforts to pass would be</c><c id=\"39\"> taken seriously by everyone around</c><c id=\"40\"> him. His failure in the</c><c id=\"41\"> exam was unexpected, and he</c><c id=\"42\"> hid it from his parents,</c><c id=\"43\"> but his teachers knew.
