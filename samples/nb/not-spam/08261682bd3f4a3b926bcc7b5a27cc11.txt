That</c><c id=\"2\"> was on the day of</c><c id=\"3\"> her marriage, and I do</c><c id=\"4\"> not have pleasant memories of</c><c id=\"5\"> my behaviour at her wedding.</c><c id=\"6\"> I had not liked the</c><c id=\"7\"> guy she was marrying, and</c><c id=\"8\"> had made no effort to</c><c id=\"9\"> hide it.</c></p><p><c id=\"10\">Right until the morning of</c><c id=\"11\"> her wedding I kept asking</c><c id=\"12\"> her, ‘Are you sure about</c><c id=\"13\"> this? It is okay to</c><c id=\"14\"> take more time to make</c><c id=\"15\"> up your mind, you know.’</c></p><p><c id=\"16\">‘Suresh Anna,’ she said, fondly,</c><c id=\"17\"> ‘I love him. I will</c><c id=\"18\"> marry him and we will</c><c id=\"19\"> be happy forever!’</c></p><p><c id=\"20\">She had met him online</c><c id=\"21\"> on a matrimonial website six</c><c id=\"22\"> months before that. They had</c><c id=\"23\"> immediately ‘connected’, as she put</c><c id=\"24\"> it. The hesitant exchange of</c><c id=\"25\"> emails had turned into long</c><c id=\"26\"> phone calls at all hours</c><c id=\"27\"> and she had fallen in</c><c id=\"28\"> love.</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"4e0f8e1f5a524cd18ebddb2d5124ed59","page_number":1,"segment_id":"801eab8129db413dab7e9a3a5eaf43df"},{"content":"<span id=\"487eb129794649a88b21f749395f723b\" class=\"segment\"><p><c id=\"0\">‘Don’t you want to meet</c><c id=\"1\"> him first? Get to know</c><c id=\"2\"> him and his family a</c><c id=\"3\"> bit more?’ I was always</c><c id=\"4\"> one for caution.</c></p><p><c id=\"5\">She only laughed. ‘Suresh Anna,</c><c id=\"6\"> you have forgotten what it</c><c id=\"7\"> is like when you are</c><c id=\"8\"> in love. This is it,</c><c id=\"9\"> I’m telling you. I cannot</c><c id=\"10\"> think of anything else. I</c><c id=\"11\"> want to marry him, have</c><c id=\"12\"> three kids and, you know,</c><c id=\"13\"> the rest of it.’</c></p><p><c id=\"14\">Her laughter was rich with</c><c id=\"15\"> the deliciousness of her newfound</c><c id=\"16\"> love and the dreams she</c><c id=\"17\"> had. My warnings jarred against</c><c id=\"18\"> her joy.</c></p><p><c id=\"19\">It wasn’t that I had</c><c id=\"20\"> any real reasons against the</c><c id=\"21\"> match. Call it a vague</c><c id=\"22\"> misgiving. It seemed a little</c><c id=\"23\"> dodgy.

What sort of</c><c id=\"30\"> a job was a lab</c><c id=\"31\"> assistant’s anyway? And why should</c><c id=\"32\"> he be living with a</c><c id=\"33\"> roommate at his age?</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"4e0f8e1f5a524cd18ebddb2d5124ed59","page_number":2,"segment_id":"487eb129794649a88b21f749395f723b"},{"content":"<span id=\"268f86277a274e5c91818b404a327731\" class=\"segment\"><p><c id=\"0\">I didn’t like it.</c></p><p><c id=\"1\">The only picture of Rajesh</c><c id=\"2\"> I had seen hadn’t done</c><c id=\"3\"> much to change my views.</c></p><p><c id=\"4\">‘Looks don’t matter,’ Vidhu declared.</c><c id=\"5\"> ‘I am sure he looks</c><c id=\"6\"> better in person.
