I reassessed my approach</c><c id=\"23\"> to this book. Instead of</c><c id=\"24\"> telling the stories of 500-plus</c><c id=\"25\"> soldiers, I would focus on</c><c id=\"26\"> a smaller cast of characters</c><c id=\"27\"> and make them come alive,</c><c id=\"28\"> narrating the story of the</c><c id=\"29\"> war through their eyes. I’d</c><c id=\"30\"> like to think that although</c><c id=\"31\"> this book does not mention</c><c id=\"32\"> every hero who sacrificed his</c><c id=\"33\"> life in the Kargil war,</c><c id=\"34\"> it represents each one of</c><c id=\"35\"> them.</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"3f42f8f8ab1446178f32cbf4e00a3c7f","page_number":15,"segment_id":"e6a1ece1842e4f12866093a13729430c"},{"content":"<span id=\"3eb58e9deaf34bacad4d64e3d6650b95\" class=\"segment\"><p><c id=\"0\">The heroes of Kargil had</c><c id=\"1\"> a lot more in common</c><c id=\"2\"> than what met the eye.</c><c id=\"3\"> They talked, walked and breathed</c><c id=\"4\"> the same language and thoughts.</c><c id=\"5\"> Indeed, the letters and journal</c><c id=\"6\"> entries that I read often</c><c id=\"7\"> seemed as if they were</c><c id=\"8\"> written by one person. Their</c><c id=\"9\"> love for their country, their</c><c id=\"10\"> ties to their families, their</c><c id=\"11\"> constant efforts to protect their</c><c id=\"12\"> loved ones from feeling nervous,</c><c id=\"13\"> the absence of regret about</c><c id=\"14\"> their decisions, their complete focus</c><c id=\"15\"> – these were the distinctive</c><c id=\"16\"> preoccupations of the soldiers that</c><c id=\"17\"> come across in the letters</c><c id=\"18\"> you are about to read.</c></p><p><c id=\"19\">A war like the Kargil</c><c id=\"20\"> war will not be fought</c><c id=\"21\"> again.
