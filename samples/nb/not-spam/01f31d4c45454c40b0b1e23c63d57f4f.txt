At</c><c id=\"7\"> the foot of the church</c><c id=\"8\"> stood a smithy, generally red</c><c id=\"9\"> with fires and always littered</c><c id=\"10\"> with hammers and scraps of</c><c id=\"11\"> iron; opposite to this, over</c><c id=\"12\"> a rude cross of cobbled</c><c id=\"13\"> paths, was ‘The Blue Boar’,</c><c id=\"14\"> the only inn of the</c><c id=\"15\"> place. It was upon this</c><c id=\"16\"> crossway, in the lifting of</c><c id=\"17\"> a leaden and silver daybreak,</c><c id=\"18\"> that two brothers met in</c><c id=\"19\"> the street and spoke; though</c><c id=\"20\"> one was beginning the day</c><c id=\"21\"> and the other finishing it.</c><c id=\"22\"> The Rev. and Hon. Wilfred</c><c id=\"23\"> Bohun was very devout, and</c><c id=\"24\"> was making his way to</c><c id=\"25\"> some austere exercises of prayer</c><c id=\"26\"> or contemplation at dawn. Colonel</c><c id=\"27\"> the Hon. Norman Bohun, his</c><c id=\"28\"> elder brother, was by no</c><c id=\"29\"> means devout, and was sitting</c><c id=\"30\"> in evening dress on the</c><c id=\"31\"> bench outside ‘The Blue Boar’,</c><c id=\"32\"> drinking what the philosophic observer</c><c id=\"33\"> was free to regard either</c><c id=\"34\"> as his last glass on</c><c id=\"35\"> Tuesday or his first on</c><c id=\"36\"> Wednesday.

But it</c><c id=\"5\"> is a great mistake to</c><c id=\"6\"> suppose that such houses stand</c><c id=\"7\"> high in chivalric tradition. Few</c><c id=\"8\"> except the poor preserve traditions.</c><c id=\"9\"> Aristocrats live not in traditions</c><c id=\"10\"> but in fashions. The Bohuns</c><c id=\"11\"> had been Mohocks under Queen</c><c id=\"12\"> Anne and Mashers under Queen</c><c id=\"13\"> Victoria. But like more than</c><c id=\"14\"> one of the really ancient</c><c id=\"15\"> houses, they had rotted in</c><c id=\"16\"> the last two centuries into</c><c id=\"17\"> mere drunkards and dandy degenerates,</c><c id=\"18\"> till there had even come</c><c id=\"19\"> a whisper of insanity. Certainly</c><c id=\"20\"> there was something hardly human</c><c id=\"21\"> about the colonel’s wolfish pursuit</c><c id=\"22\"> of pleasure, and his chronic</c><c id=\"23\"> resolution not to go home</c><c id=\"24\"> till morning had a touch</c><c id=\"25\"> of the hideous clarity of</c><c id=\"26\"> insomnia. He was a tall,</c><c id=\"27\"> fine animal, elderly, but with</c><c id=\"28\"> hair still startlingly yellow. He</c><c id=\"29\"> would have looked merely blond</c><c id=\"30\"> and leonine, but his blue</c><c id=\"31\"> eyes were sunk so deep</c><c id=\"32\"> in his face that they</c><c id=\"33\"> looked black. They were a</c><c id=\"34\"> little too close together. He</c><c id=\"35\"> had very long yellow moustaches;</c><c id=\"36\"> on each side of them</c><c id=\"37\"> a fold or furrow from</c><c id=\"38\"> nostril to jaw, so that</c><c id=\"39\"> a sneer seemed cut into</c><c id=\"40\"> his face. Over his evening</c><c id=\"41\"> clothes he wore a curious</c><c id=\"42\"> pale yellow coat that looked</c><c id=\"43\"> more like a very light</c><c id=\"44\"> dressing-gown than an overcoat, and</c><c id=\"45\"> on the back of his</c><c id=\"46\"> head was stuck an extraordinary</c><c id=\"47\"> broadbrimmed hat of a bright</c><c id=\"48\"> green colour, evidently some oriental</c><c id=\"49\"> curiosity caught up at random.</c><c id=\"50\"> He was proud of appearing</c><c id=\"51\"> in such incongruous attires proud</c><c id=\"52\"> of the fact that he</c><c id=\"53\"> always made them look congruous.</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"ed375220de594412963a0732244e44d7","page_number":2,"segment_id":"bf6d9320f1ea4198b2540a5671be6841"},{"content":"<span id=\"4f30155f9ee042b59d26fb3dfaf478e9\" class=\"segment\"><p><c id=\"0\">His brother the curate had</c><c id=\"1\"> also the yellow hair and</c><c id=\"2\"> the elegance, but he was</c><c id=\"3\"> buttoned up to the chin</c><c id=\"4\"> in black, and his face</c><c id=\"5\"> was clean-shaven, cultivated, and a</c><c id=\"6\"> little nervous. He seemed to</c><c id=\"7\"> live for nothing but his</c><c id=\"8\"> religion; but there were some</c><c id=\"9\"> who said (notably the blacksmith,</c><c id=\"10\"> who was a Presbyterian) that</c><c id=\"11\"> it was a love of</c><c id=\"12\"> Gothic architecture rather than of</c><c id=\"13\"> God, and that his haunting</c><c id=\"14\"> of the church like a</c><c id=\"15\"> ghost was only another and</c><c id=\"16\"> purer turn of the almost</c><c id=\"17\"> morbid thirst for beauty which</c><c id=\"18\"> sent his brother raging after</c><c id=\"19\"> women and wine. This charge</c><c id=\"20\"> was doubtful, while the man’s</c><c id=\"21\"> practical piety was indubitable. Indeed,</c><c id=\"22\"> the charge was mostly an</c><c id=\"23\"> ignorant misunderstanding of the love</c><c id=\"24\"> of solitude and secret prayer,</c><c id=\"25\"> and was founded on his</c><c id=\"26\"> being often found kneeling, not</c><c id=\"27\"> before the altar, but in</c><c id=\"28\"> peculiar places, in the crypts</c><c id=\"29\"> or gallery, or even in</c><c id=\"30\"> the belfry. He was at</c><c id=\"31\"> the moment about to enter</c><c id=\"32\"> the church through the yard</c><c id=\"33\"> of the smithy, but stopped</c><c id=\"34\"> and frowned a little as</c><c id=\"35\"> he saw his brother’s cavernous</c><c id=\"36\"> eyes staring in the same</c><c id=\"37\"> direction. On the hypothesis that</c><c id=\"38\"> the colonel was interested in</c><c id=\"39\"> the church he did not</c><c id=\"40\"> waste any speculations. There only</c><c id=\"41\"> remained the blacksmith’s shop, and</c><c id=\"42\"> though the blacksmith was a</c><c id=\"43\"> Puritan and none of his</c><c id=\"44\"> people, Wilfred Bohun had heard</c><c id=\"45\"> some scandals about a beautiful</c><c id=\"46\"> and rather celebrated wife.” He</c><c id=\"47\"> flung a suspicious look across</c><c id=\"48\"> the shed, and the colonel</c><c id=\"49\"> stood up laughing to speak</c><c id=\"50\"> to him.</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"ed375220de594412963a0732244e44d7","page_number":3,"segment_id":"4f30155f9ee042b59d26fb3dfaf478e9"},{"content":"<span id=\"6b688eb4c3ac4bdbbba2fb84749fc7d5\" class=\"segment\"><p><c id=\"0\">‘Good morning, Wilfred,’ he said.</c><c id=\"1\"> ‘Like a good landlord I</c><c id=\"2\"> am watching sleeplessly over my</c><c id=\"3\"> people.
