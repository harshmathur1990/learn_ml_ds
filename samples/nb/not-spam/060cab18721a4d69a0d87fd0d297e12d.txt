Below</c><c id=\"4\"> was the number of the</c><c id=\"5\"> person to be contacted, which</c><c id=\"6\"> I had tried to read</c><c id=\"7\"> and memorize in a glance</c><c id=\"8\"> a few times during my</c><c id=\"9\"> walks. And now, as I</c><c id=\"10\"> stood there typing it on</c><c id=\"11\"> my phone, I couldn’t avoid</c><c id=\"12\"> feeling embarrassed. Shernaz was a</c><c id=\"13\"> prim and proper lady, the</c><c id=\"14\"> kind of person for whom</c><c id=\"15\"> grammatical correctness is a question</c><c id=\"16\"> of hygiene. She explained what</c><c id=\"17\"> the job was and how</c><c id=\"18\"> much I would be paid.</c><c id=\"19\"> There was a lot of</c><c id=\"20\"> sweeping to do, mostly dried</c><c id=\"21\"> leaves from the great maple</c><c id=\"22\"> in the garden but also</c><c id=\"23\"> all other kinds of dead</c><c id=\"24\"> leaves. She gave me a</c><c id=\"25\"> worried look now and then,</c><c id=\"26\"> as if I would disappear</c><c id=\"27\"> mid-sentence like a ghost and</c><c id=\"28\"> she would be unable to</c><c id=\"29\"> bear such an insult. ‘But</c><c id=\"30\"> of course,’ her partner John</c><c id=\"31\"> said, ‘the work is hardly</c><c id=\"32\"> strenuous. It’s just simply mind-bogglingly</c><c id=\"33\"> boring.’ Shernaz felt it was</c><c id=\"34\"> her duty to tell me</c><c id=\"35\"> that any 5-star or 4-star</c><c id=\"36\"> hotel in the area would,</c><c id=\"37\"> if they had a vacancy,</c><c id=\"38\"> be glad to hire me</c><c id=\"39\"> as a receptionist or a</c><c id=\"40\"> good school in town as</c><c id=\"41\"> a teacher. Maybe I should</c><c id=\"42\"> consider these options before making</c><c id=\"43\"> up my mind because she</c><c id=\"44\"> could only pay me a</c><c id=\"45\"> sum that would be far</c><c id=\"46\"> below my expectations, nonetheless much</c><c id=\"47\"> more than what she would</c><c id=\"48\"> pay a Gaddi boy.</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"e4bd6b804d5c4bc681bb31a9a14df413","page_number":1,"segment_id":"d2bf403684b84514ab62cafbe8aee775"},{"content":"<span id=\"031f81ad5d0b46c392fdd84fd4e01d29\" class=\"segment\"><p><c id=\"0\">John took me around the</c><c id=\"1\"> grounds. ‘As you can see,’</c><c id=\"2\"> he was saying in a</c><c id=\"3\"> voice edging close to Attenborough’s,</c><c id=\"4\"> ‘we have quite a few</c><c id=\"5\"> trees and they all begin</c><c id=\"6\"> to shed about this time</c><c id=\"7\"> of the year.

Two small furry dogs</c><c id=\"5\"> rushed towards us, sniffing my</c><c id=\"6\"> legs excitedly.
