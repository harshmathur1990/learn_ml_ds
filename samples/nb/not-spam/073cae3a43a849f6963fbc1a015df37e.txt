The hair</c><c id=\"32\"> on the back of his</c><c id=\"33\"> neck stood up as the</c><c id=\"34\"> faintest sound came from the</c><c id=\"35\"> shadows.

The</c><c id=\"3\"> heat was almost unbearable at</c><c id=\"4\"> this time of year –</c><c id=\"5\"> summer, referred to by the</c><c id=\"6\"> Taliban as the fighting season.</c><c id=\"7\"> While the cool draught of</c><c id=\"8\"> air brought some respite from</c><c id=\"9\"> the searing heat, it also</c><c id=\"10\"> carried the smell to him</c><c id=\"11\"> again, a pungent odour. Joel</c><c id=\"12\"> shivered. Staring into the night,</c><c id=\"13\"> he could barely see the</c><c id=\"14\"> outline of the mountains behind</c><c id=\"15\"> the lush Mirabad Valley. Though</c><c id=\"16\"> only eight kilometres from the</c><c id=\"17\"> coalition base, Mirabad may as</c><c id=\"18\"> well have been a hundred:</c><c id=\"19\"> it was a different world</c><c id=\"20\"> out there.

Joel had been part</c><c id=\"26\"> of a patrol that had</c><c id=\"27\"> been ambushed the week before.</c><c id=\"28\"> Two of his friends had</c><c id=\"29\"> been killed and at one</c><c id=\"30\"> point the section was almost</c><c id=\"31\"> overrun. When they finally returned</c><c id=\"32\"> to the base the section</c><c id=\"33\"> commander was relieved from his</c><c id=\"34\"> position, deemed not up to</c><c id=\"35\"> the task.

Working</c><c id=\"2\"> with the Afghan partner force</c><c id=\"3\"> could be challenging at times,</c><c id=\"4\"> but for the most part</c><c id=\"5\"> it was rewarding.
