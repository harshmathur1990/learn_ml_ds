Habibullah wanted</c><c id=\"44\"> to retire and lead a</c><c id=\"45\"> normal life. He wanted to</c><c id=\"46\"> play with his children and</c><c id=\"47\"> grandchildren. He wanted to look</c><c id=\"48\"> through the window of his</c><c id=\"49\"> house, with his wife serving</c><c id=\"50\"> him tea, when it snowed</c><c id=\"51\"> in the mountains. He was</c><c id=\"52\"> considering a life after retirement</c><c id=\"53\"> for the last six months.</c><c id=\"54\"> Earlier, he never considered himself</c><c id=\"55\"> living another month.

In fact, before each</c><c id=\"74\"> raid, he prepared himself to</c><c id=\"75\"> die, and this craving to</c><c id=\"76\"> die was more in the</c><c id=\"77\"> recent years.
