To cut a</c><c id=\"3\"> long story short when Ghiyasuddin</c><c id=\"4\"> Tughlaq took the throne he</c><c id=\"5\"> also founded another new city</c><c id=\"6\"> nearby. He named it Tughlaqabad</c><c id=\"7\"> and left the stamp of</c><c id=\"8\"> his lineage on it. What</c><c id=\"9\"> a palace he built; when</c><c id=\"10\"> the rays of the sun</c><c id=\"11\"> fell on it the city</c><c id=\"12\"> shone like gold so brilliantly</c><c id=\"13\"> that one could hardly glance</c><c id=\"14\"> at it. In fact, the</c><c id=\"15\"> bricks used to build this</c><c id=\"16\"> palace were gold-plated. But Tughlaqabad</c><c id=\"17\"> did not bode well for</c><c id=\"18\"> Tughlaq. Just when the palace</c><c id=\"19\"> was completed, the King died.</c><c id=\"20\"> And what a strange way</c><c id=\"21\"> to die! He was on</c><c id=\"22\"> a military expedition to Bengal.</c><c id=\"23\"> As he was returning, his</c><c id=\"24\"> son, who was the crown</c><c id=\"25\"> prince and later became famous</c><c id=\"26\"> as Muhammad Bin Tughlaq, built</c><c id=\"27\"> a small palace on the</c><c id=\"28\"> outposts of the city for</c><c id=\"29\"> the king to rest in</c><c id=\"30\"> and freshen up before he</c><c id=\"31\"> entered Tughlaqabad. But the palace</c><c id=\"32\"> was built in such a</c><c id=\"33\"> strange way that the moment</c><c id=\"34\"> His Majesty set foot in</c><c id=\"35\"> it, it came crashing down</c><c id=\"36\"> on top of him.</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"ec0c7e1a384049e9b820175f17b0ad7f","page_number":38,"segment_id":"1f7ece59f0d946619f3f49feeed32642"},{"content":"<span id=\"c821b16b52884633af8e6550d6809aeb\" class=\"segment\"><p><c id=\"0\">So,Tughlaqabad was destroyed right after</c><c id=\"1\"> it was settled; actually, even</c><c id=\"2\"> before the construction had finished.</c><c id=\"3\"> And consider the son who</c><c id=\"4\"> could not stand being enthroned</c><c id=\"5\"> in this capital and this</c><c id=\"6\"> palace.

It was this throne</c><c id=\"21\"> that was named </c><em><c id=\"22\">Takht-e-taaus</c></em><c id=\"23\">.

The takht</c><c id=\"27\"> and the legs, everything was</c><c id=\"28\"> made of solid gold.

Between the peacocks</c><c id=\"36\"> there was a parrot made</c><c id=\"37\"> of emerald. The shamiyana over</c><c id=\"38\"> the takht was glittering with</c><c id=\"39\"> gemstones. A silver pavilion was</c><c id=\"40\"> placed a little further away</c><c id=\"41\"> from here. According to the </c><em><c id=\"42\">Waqeyaat Darul Hukumat Dehli</c></em><c id=\"43\">, ‘Outside the pavilion first</c><c id=\"44\"> there were the warriors, the</c><c id=\"45\"> rich, and the illustrious princes.</c><c id=\"46\"> After them rulers, noblemen from</c><c id=\"47\"> various countries, and minor aristocrats</c><c id=\"48\"> were standing in order of</c><c id=\"49\"> their stature. But all these</c><c id=\"50\"> obedient courtiers kept their eyes</c><c id=\"51\"> fixed on the ground and</c><c id=\"52\"> their hearts set to follow</c><c id=\"53\"> the orders of their sovereign.</c><c id=\"54\"> In each arch two soldiers</c><c id=\"55\"> with special rifles in velvet</c><c id=\"56\"> covers and flags stood at</c><c id=\"57\"> attention like statues. In the</c><c id=\"58\"> outer courtyard the other officers,</c><c id=\"59\"> jagirdars, and mansabdars stood awaiting</c><c id=\"60\"> any orders. In the next</c><c id=\"61\"> pavilion there were three black</c><c id=\"62\"> giants from Abyssinia, their eyes</c><c id=\"63\"> bloodshot, wearing brocade uniforms, loaded</c><c id=\"64\"> with weapons, a mace on</c><c id=\"65\"> the iron shoulders, the flags</c><c id=\"66\"> in their hands fluttering like</c><c id=\"67\"> clouds. In the third rank</c><c id=\"68\"> there were the officials in</c><c id=\"69\"> charge of the clerical and</c><c id=\"70\"> dispatches sections; scribes and accountants</c><c id=\"71\"> were present with their pen-stands</c><c id=\"72\"> tied to their waists and</c><c id=\"73\"> their bags at the ready.</c><c id=\"74\"> In the next arches soldiers</c><c id=\"75\"> standing quietly next to the</c><c id=\"76\"> silver railings as high as</c><c id=\"77\"> themselves displayed their bare swords.</c><c id=\"78\"> Indeed, outside the pavilion, after</c><c id=\"79\"> every 30 yards there was</c><c id=\"80\"> a silver railing. Stationed next</c><c id=\"81\"> to it, were the brave</c><c id=\"82\"> special soldiers of the king</c><c id=\"83\"> wearing their sparkling uniforms, with</c><c id=\"84\"> golden and silver flags in</c><c id=\"85\"> their hands.

At night the</c><c id=\"2\"> moonlit celebration was unleashed which</c><c id=\"3\"> had its own excitement.</c></p><p><c id=\"4\">The celebration went on for</c><c id=\"5\"> nine days. Thus was the</c><c id=\"6\"> opening of the fort of</c><c id=\"7\"> Shahjahan. The fort would now</c><c id=\"8\"> be called Lal Qila and</c><c id=\"9\"> enjoy an eternally famous stature.</c></p><p><c id=\"10\">The King’s house having been</c><c id=\"11\"> built, it was now time</c><c id=\"12\"> to build Allah’s house. That</c><c id=\"13\"> is the Shahjahani mosque right</c><c id=\"14\"> in front of the Shahjahani</c><c id=\"15\"> fort. The fort was ready</c><c id=\"16\"> in 1648 AD. The construction</c><c id=\"17\"> of the mosque was completed</c><c id=\"18\"> in 1650 AD. But this</c><c id=\"19\"> Masjid was not built so</c><c id=\"20\"> easily. It also has a</c><c id=\"21\"> story. Nasir Nazir Firaq’s Nani</c><c id=\"22\"> Dulhan had the penchant to</c><c id=\"23\"> turn every incident into an</c><c id=\"24\"> entire story. So this is</c><c id=\"25\"> in her own words. At</c><c id=\"26\"> the time when the foundation</c><c id=\"27\"> of the mosque was being</c><c id=\"28\"> filled, the architect vanished along</c><c id=\"29\"> with the plans. Ultimately hope</c><c id=\"30\"> of finding him alive was</c><c id=\"31\"> abandoned. In a bid to</c><c id=\"32\"> find his body the wells</c><c id=\"33\"> were stirred with bamboo. One</c><c id=\"34\"> year passed, the second passed</c><c id=\"35\"> and then the third year</c><c id=\"36\"> passed. No news still of</c><c id=\"37\"> the architect. When three years</c><c id=\"38\"> had passed, the architect appeared</c><c id=\"39\"> one day suddenly, went to</c><c id=\"40\"> the court and stood there</c><c id=\"41\"> with folded hands. ‘My lord,</c><c id=\"42\"> I’d like to say something</c><c id=\"43\"> if my life be spared.</c><c id=\"44\"> The building of the mosque</c><c id=\"45\"> was getting very heavy. It</c><c id=\"46\"> was dangerous to build such</c><c id=\"47\"> a heavy building on a</c><c id=\"48\"> new foundation. The rain water</c><c id=\"49\"> would seep into the foundation</c><c id=\"50\"> and with it the doorways</c><c id=\"51\"> and walls would have sagged.</c><c id=\"52\"> With that the arches and</c><c id=\"53\"> beams would have slumped. Considering</c><c id=\"54\"> this, I made a sacrifice</c><c id=\"55\"> and went into hiding. Now</c><c id=\"56\"> that the foundation has survived</c><c id=\"57\"> three rainy seasons it is</c><c id=\"58\"> as strong as a pillar</c><c id=\"59\"> of iron. The building that</c><c id=\"60\"> is erected now will continue</c><c id=\"61\"> to stand tall for centuries.’</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"2081bcf005a54feaa0e5bc03a7f55033","page_number":75,"segment_id":"e5fad97633ad433a88156e8a032b0cd6"}],"chapter_data":[{"chapter_id":"138a40c5e86248cc8f63286e8e11b2dc","heading_data":{"html":"<div
