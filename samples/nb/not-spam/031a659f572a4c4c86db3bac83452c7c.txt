He had felt his</c><c id=\"20\"> piercing gaze even from that</c><c id=\"21\"> distance after the King had</c><c id=\"22\"> fallen. The horrifying tales of</c><c id=\"23\"> the Guardians were prevalent in</c><c id=\"24\"> the eastern shores also, yet</c><c id=\"25\"> he never knew the horrors</c><c id=\"26\"> of it until that night.</c><c id=\"27\"> No man, not even a</c><c id=\"28\"> King was safe from their</c><c id=\"29\"> clutches and he was just</c><c id=\"30\"> a mere merchant. The Eastern</c><c id=\"31\"> kingdoms had nothing to do</c><c id=\"32\"> with the ‘Abode of the</c><c id=\"33\"> Seven’ and so the Guardians</c><c id=\"34\"> were never seen to walk</c><c id=\"35\"> the eastern shores. Yet the</c><c id=\"36\"> very thought of them made</c><c id=\"37\"> him shiver. Each night he</c><c id=\"38\"> would close the main door</c><c id=\"39\"> of the Captain’s quarters with</c><c id=\"40\"> three different locks. He would</c><c id=\"41\"> pull the curtains and bar</c><c id=\"42\"> the windows. Only then some</c><c id=\"43\"> sleep would creep upon him</c><c id=\"44\"> and he’d hope for a</c><c id=\"45\"> dreamless sleep. The dread had</c><c id=\"46\"> taken its toll on him</c><c id=\"47\"> in the twenty long years</c><c id=\"48\"> and he had grown tired</c><c id=\"49\"> of it. But an oath</c><c id=\"50\"> is an oath, taken before</c><c id=\"51\"> the Eternal one; it was</c><c id=\"52\"> meant to be kept for</c><c id=\"53\"> life. Besides, it was also</c><c id=\"54\"> for the sake of his</c><c id=\"55\"> daughter. He knew that a</c><c id=\"56\"> few nightmares won’t bring any</c><c id=\"57\"> harm to him, which seemed</c><c id=\"58\"> more vivid than usual; but</c><c id=\"59\"> he dreaded the day when</c><c id=\"60\"> they would creep out of</c><c id=\"61\"> his dreams; maybe that was</c><c id=\"62\"> the only reason he for</c><c id=\"63\"> his returning to that cursed</c><c id=\"64\"> land after a long period</c><c id=\"65\"> of nineteen years.</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"f175e85a7ed04a9e9fb439744c0d63cb","page_number":19,"segment_id":"83a3ca6ab4a34d7196d6c7c0cb766cd4"},{"content":"<span id=\"25d211c9d608404f86de7154570ebd20\" class=\"segment\"><p><c id=\"0\">“Father,” came a feminine voice</c><c id=\"1\"> which startled Briksha.
