The night was cold,</c><c id=\"8\"> and they had both pulled</c><c id=\"9\"> up their chairs to the</c><c id=\"10\"> unsatisfactory Italian stove which threw</c><c id=\"11\"> out a zone of stuffiness</c><c id=\"12\"> rather than of warmth. Outside</c><c id=\"13\"> under the bright winter stars</c><c id=\"14\"> lay the modern Rome, the</c><c id=\"15\"> long, double chain of the</c><c id=\"16\"> electric lamps, the brilliantly lighted</c><c id=\"17\"> cafes, the rushing carriages, and</c><c id=\"18\"> the dense throng upon the</c><c id=\"19\"> footpaths. But inside, in the</c><c id=\"20\"> sumptuous chamber of the rich</c><c id=\"21\"> young English archaeologist, there was</c><c id=\"22\"> only old Rome to be</c><c id=\"23\"> seen. Cracked and timeworn friezes</c><c id=\"24\"> hung upon the walls, grey</c><c id=\"25\"> old busts of senators and</c><c id=\"26\"> soldiers with their fighting heads</c><c id=\"27\"> and their hard, cruel faces</c><c id=\"28\"> peered out from the corners.</c><c id=\"29\"> On the centre table, amidst</c><c id=\"30\"> a litter of inscriptions, fragments,</c><c id=\"31\"> and ornaments, there stood the</c><c id=\"32\"> famous reconstruction by Kennedy of</c><c id=\"33\"> the Baths of Caracalla, which</c><c id=\"34\"> excited such interest and admiration</c><c id=\"35\"> when it was exhibited in</c><c id=\"36\"> Berlin. Amphorae hung from the</c><c id=\"37\"> ceiling, and a litter of</c><c id=\"38\"> curiosities strewed the rich red</c><c id=\"39\"> Turkey carpet. And of them</c><c id=\"40\"> all there was not one</c><c id=\"41\"> which was not of the</c><c id=\"42\"> most unimpeachable authenticity, and of</c><c id=\"43\"> the utmost rarity and value;</c><c id=\"44\"> for Kennedy, though little more</c><c id=\"45\"> than thirty, had a European</c><c id=\"46\"> reputation in this particular branch</c><c id=\"47\"> of research, and was, moreover,</c><c id=\"48\"> provided with that long purse</c><c id=\"49\"> which either proves to be</c><c id=\"50\"> a fatal handicap to the</c><c id=\"51\"> student’s energies, or, if his</c><c id=\"52\"> mind is still true to</c><c id=\"53\"> its purpose, gives him an</c><c id=\"54\"> enormous advantage in the race</c><c id=\"55\"> for fame. Kennedy had often</c><c id=\"56\"> been seduced by whim and</c><c id=\"57\"> pleasure from his studies, but</c><c id=\"58\"> his mind was an incisive</c><c id=\"59\"> one, capable of long and</c><c id=\"60\"> concentrated efforts which ended in</c><c id=\"61\"> sharp reactions of sensuous languor.</c><c id=\"62\"> His handsome face, with its</c><c id=\"63\"> high, white forehead, its aggressive</c><c id=\"64\"> nose, and its somewhat loose</c><c id=\"65\"> and sensual mouth, was a</c><c id=\"66\"> fair index of the compromise</c><c id=\"67\"> between strength and weakness in</c><c id=\"68\"> his nature.</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"2b00bd40fd3b43b79220eee60a114bbe","page_number":1,"segment_id":"677beebd3dea4c74b65b4c2b608aa2c5"},{"content":"<span id=\"1f4f03ddd54d4d4e8bc9595d6471b370\" class=\"segment\"><p><c id=\"0\">Of a very different type</c><c id=\"1\"> was his companion, Julius Burger.</c><c id=\"2\"> He came of a curious</c><c id=\"3\"> blend, a German father and</c><c id=\"4\"> an Italian mother, with the</c><c id=\"5\"> robust qualities of the North</c><c id=\"6\"> mingling strangely with the softer</c><c id=\"7\"> graces of the South. Blue</c><c id=\"8\"> Teutonic eyes lightened his sunbrowned</c><c id=\"9\"> face, and above them rose</c><c id=\"10\"> a square, massive forehead, with</c><c id=\"11\"> a fringe of close yellow</c><c id=\"12\"> curls lying round it. His</c><c id=\"13\"> strong, firm jaw was clean-shaven,</c><c id=\"14\"> and his companion had frequently</c><c id=\"15\"> remarked how much it suggested</c><c id=\"16\"> those old Roman busts which</c><c id=\"17\"> peered out from the shadows</c><c id=\"18\"> in the corners of his</c><c id=\"19\"> chamber. Under its bluff German</c><c id=\"20\"> strength there lay always a</c><c id=\"21\"> suggestion of Italian subtlety, but</c><c id=\"22\"> the smile was so honest,</c><c id=\"23\"> and the eyes so frank,</c><c id=\"24\"> that one understood that this</c><c id=\"25\"> was only an indication of</c><c id=\"26\"> his ancestry, with no actual</c><c id=\"27\"> bearing upon his character. In</c><c id=\"28\"> age and in reputation, he</c><c id=\"29\"> was on the same level</c><c id=\"30\"> as his English companion, but</c><c id=\"31\"> his life and his work</c><c id=\"32\"> had both been far more</c><c id=\"33\"> arduous. Twelve years before, he</c><c id=\"34\"> had come as a poor</c><c id=\"35\"> student to Rome, and had</c><c id=\"36\"> lived ever since upon some</c><c id=\"37\"> small endowment for research which</c><c id=\"38\"> had been awarded to him</c><c id=\"39\"> by the University of Bonn.</c><c id=\"40\"> Painfully, slowly, and doggedly, with</c><c id=\"41\"> extraordinary tenacity and singlemindedness, he</c><c id=\"42\"> had climbed from rung to</c><c id=\"43\"> rung of the ladder of</c><c id=\"44\"> fame, until now he was</c><c id=\"45\"> a member of the Berlin</c><c id=\"46\"> Academy, and there was every</c><c id=\"47\"> reason to believe that he</c><c id=\"48\"> would shortly be promoted to</c><c id=\"49\"> the Chair of the greatest</c><c id=\"50\"> of German Universities. But the</c><c id=\"51\"> singleness of purpose which had</c><c id=\"52\"> brought him to the same</c><c id=\"53\"> high level as the rich</c><c id=\"54\"> and brilliant Englishman, had caused</c><c id=\"55\"> him in everything outside their</c><c id=\"56\"> work to stand infinitely below</c><c id=\"57\"> him. He had never found</c><c id=\"58\"> a pause in his studies</c><c id=\"59\"> in which to cultivate the</c><c id=\"60\"> social graces. It was only</c><c id=\"61\"> when he spoke of his</c><c id=\"62\"> own subject that his face</c><c id=\"63\"> was filled with life and</c><c id=\"64\"> soul. At other times he</c><c id=\"65\"> was silent and embarrassed, too</c><c id=\"66\"> conscious of his own limitations</c><c id=\"67\"> in larger subjects, and impatient</c><c id=\"68\"> of that small talk which</c><c id=\"69\"> is the conventional refuge of</c><c id=\"70\"> those who have no thoughts</c><c id=\"71\"> to express.</c></p></span>","chapter_id":"2b00bd40fd3b43b79220eee60a114bbe","page_number":2,"segment_id":"1f4f03ddd54d4d4e8bc9595d6471b370"},{"content":"<span id=\"be1dcb20935f44debe403febdcf2dcc4\" class=\"segment\"><p><c id=\"0\">And yet for some years</c><c id=\"1\"> there had been an acquaintanceship</c></p><p><c id=\"2\">which appeared to be slowly</c><c id=\"3\"> ripening into a friendship between</c><c id=\"4\"> these two very different rivals.</c><c id=\"5\"> The base and origin of</c><c id=\"6\"> this lay  in the fact</c><c id=\"7\"> that in their own studies</c><c id=\"8\"> each was the only one</c><c id=\"9\"> of the younger men who</c><c id=\"10\"> had knowledge and enthusiasm enough</c><c id=\"11\"> to properly appreciate the other.</c><c id=\"12\"> Their common interests and pursuits</c><c id=\"13\"> had brought them together, and</c><c id=\"14\"> each had been attracted by</c><c id=\"15\"> the other’s knowledge. And then</c><c id=\"16\"> gradually something had been added</c><c id=\"17\"> to this. Kennedy had been</c><c id=\"18\"> amused by the frankness and</c><c id=\"19\"> simplicity of his rival, while</c><c id=\"20\"> Burger in turn had been</c><c id=\"21\"> fascinated by the brilliancy and</c><c id=\"22\"> vivacity which had made Kennedy</c><c id=\"23\"> such a favourite in Roman</c><c id=\"24\"> society. I say ‘had’, because</c><c id=\"25\"> just at the moment the</c><c id=\"26\"> young Englishman was somewhat under</c><c id=\"27\"> a cloud. A love-affair, the</c><c id=\"28\"> details of which had never</c><c id=\"29\"> quite come out, had indicated</c><c id=\"30\"> a heartlessness and callousness upon</c><c id=\"31\"> his part which shocked many</c><c id=\"32\"> of his friends.
